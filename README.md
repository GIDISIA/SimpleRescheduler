This repository contains the Soar implementation of Case Study [Barsce, Palombarini & Martinez (2013)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/263108607_A_Cognitive_Approach_to_Real-time_Rescheduling_using_SOAR-RL), that consisted in a schedule composed with 3 semi-continuous extruders that process four types of products and a total of 16 tasks.

The code can be executed using the Soar debugger and loading the productions in the Scheduler.soar file.

This code is no longer maintained. Last updated: 10/2013
